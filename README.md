## TODO in this repo

- refactoring Profile responsive ❌
- problem with multiple list of user (RecoverAccount & ListOfUser in the hook)❌
- Import PDF and pin it to IPFS (use pinata.fromFS) INTEGRATE to function publish ❌
- PDF hash =>

```js
header: {
  version: 0.1,
  title: "Studies on ETH providers",
  abstract: "So hard to built this....",
  content: (hash) {
    version: 0.1,
    content: "For the moment nothing is done...",
    pdfFile: hash
    },
}
```

- manage article/undefined article❌ => 404
- add color theme in Chakra (create a little graphical charter)❌
- Crawler with `react-router-dom`❌

```js
articleInfo = {
  title: "",
  content: "",
  pdfFile: "bafkreibbo5dlexsozwr5ac34lfuy6bwq4ixcj5wx5injqa74mlq5wybgs4",
}
```

- REVIEW DAPP (inspect & write comment) => Architecture
- README
- MERGE with main

## TODO in the backend

- deployment on several blockchain (matic & bsc) with the same address ❌
- add metrics❌
- put articleID on indexed ! And author ID❌
- governance (see tomorrow the openzepplin live at 9PM)
- ++ replace [] => mapping

## TODO in data architecture

- create standard for object keys stored in IPFS

Exemple:

```js
userInfo = { firstName: "", lastName: "", email: "" }
```

```js
profileCID: String {
  version: 0.1,
  email: "rogert@food.com",
  laboratory: "Ministry of Food",
  bio: "Eat some Tacos...",
  nameCID: String {
    version: 0.1,
    firstName: "Rogert",
    lastName: "Culinaire"
  },
}
```

- save permanent information like name

```js
abstractCID: String {
  version: 0.1,
  title: "Studies on ETH providers",
  abstract: "So hard to built this....",
  content: String {
    version: 0.1,
    content: "For the moment nothing is done...",
    pdfFile: String // new feature, almost all articles in this version do not have this key
    },
}
```

`userInfo` stay the same
